Orange Trickymimic
==================
My wife and I make a simple orange triaminic workalike using common drugs, corn syrup and
mio.  We also keep a bottle of placebo that is prepared similarly, so that we can get the
placebo effect of calming when his problem isn't that he's stuffy, but insecure.  For the
placebo, simply leave out the sudafed and benadryl.

This makes a syrup that should be given as 1.25ml/10 lbs (1 tsp/40 lbs), with a dosage of
0.35 mg/lb pseudoepinephrine, and 0.4 mg/lb diphenhydramine, which are consistent with
FDA dosage recommendations for these drugs.

Ingredients
-----------
* 11 Sudafed (330 mg total)
* 15 Benadryl (375 mg total)
* 115 ml corn syrup
* 2 ml orange Mio (about 1-2 squirts, to taste)

Directions
----------
1. Crush sudafed and benadryl
2. Make a slurry with the Mio
3. Microwave corn syrup on high, depending on your microwave's power (the idea is to not heat the stuff up too much)
