# Alien beans - Oegye Kong (???)

Based on the classic korean side dish, Kong Jang (??), this variant adds
ginger for a little depth, azuki beans for a nutty crunch, and chestnuts
for a delicious creaminess.

It is essentially just candied, boiled beans - but the sweet, salty,
nutty accompaniment is a wonderful foil to any spicy dish.

* 250 g / 1 c dry black beans
