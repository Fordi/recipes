Dark hot cocoa
==============

*  170g | 6oz       | Water @95C / 200F
*    2g | 1/4 tsp   | Vanilla extract
*   15g | 1 tbsp    | Dry milk
*    5g | 1 tsp     | Dry coconut milk
*   10g | 2 tsp     | Dark cocoa
*  2.5g | 1/2 tsp   | Decaf dry coffee (1 straw)
*  0.2g | 2 packs   | Sucralose
*    1g | 1/8 tsp   | Baking soda
* Optional (improves mouth-feel):
* 0.25g | pinch     | Iota carageenan
* Optional (reduces settling):
* 0.75g | big pinch | Sodium citrate

Combine dry ingredients and vanilla.  Using a spoon, force through a fine mesh strainer, paste included (this is important; you need to make the baking soda and cocoa interact).  Add water, alcoholic additive of choice, and serve.
