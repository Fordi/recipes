Turkey burgers
==============

Makes six patties, and can be frozen for up to 1 month. Frozen patties can be cooked straight from freezer.

* 384 g ground turkey 
* 4g unflavored gelatin
* 23g low-sodium chicken broth
* 87g white or crimini mushrooms
* 7.5g soy sauce
* 0.25g baking soda
* 12.8g vegetable oil, plus extra for brushing
* Kosher salt and pepper

1. Sprinkle gelatin over chicken broth in small bowl and let sit until gelatin softens, about 5 minutes. 
2. Pulse mushrooms in food processor until coarsely chopped, about 7 pulses, stopping and redistributing mushrooms around bowl as needed to ensure even grinding. Set mushrooms aside; do not wash food processor.
3. Place 100g / 1/2 cup of ground turkey in food processor along with softened gelatin, soy sauce, and baking soda. Process until smooth, about 2 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed. 
4. With processor running, slowly drizzle in oil, about 10 seconds; leave paste in food processor. 
5. Return mushrooms to food processor with paste and pulse to combine, 3 to 5 pulses, stopping and redistributing mixture as needed to ensure even mixing. 
6. Transfer mushroom mixture to bowl with majority of ground turkey and use hands to evenly combine.
7. With lightly greased hands, divide meat mixture into 6 balls. 
8. Flatten into 3/4-inch-thick patties about 4 inches in diameter; press shallow indentation into center of each burger to ensure even cooking. 
9. Cook burgers to 72C / 160 F
