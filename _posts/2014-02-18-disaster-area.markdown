Disaster Area (Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster)
-------------------------------------------

> _Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the dark Qualactin Zones._

Brew 1 cup moroccan mint tea

> _Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. 
> Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the 
> Algolian suns deep into the heart of the drink._

Add 1/3 cup Agave nectar and chill to near-freezing.

> _Take the juice from one bottle of that Ol' Janx Spirit_

In a shaker, add 1 part rye whiskey

> _Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V_

Add 1 part cremé de violet

> _Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture - it must be properly iced or the benzene is lost_

1 part freezer-chilled gin

> _Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it (in memory of all those happy Hikers who have died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia)._  

Pour shaker into carbonator bottle, and carbonate.

Pour 1 part of the the mint/agave mixture slowly, over the back of a silver spoon if you like.

Close the bottle and give a spin to combine everything.

Pour into a martini glass.

> _Sprinkle zamphour_

Add a sprinkle of crystallized ginger.

> _Add an olive_

A black olive works, but for best results, add a [candied green olive](http://www.chicaandjo.com/2011/02/28/candied-green-olives-recipe/) or a [candied Castelvetrano olive] (http://www.food52.com/recipes/9441_candied_olives)
