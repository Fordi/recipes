Warren's Yuzu Ginger Dream
==========================

Note: this shit is evil.  Watch your eyebrows.

Ingredients
-----------
* 1 L Chilled seltzer
* 75g Demerara sugar or other sweetener
* 120g Yuzu, lime, lemon, or other tart citrus juice
* 50g Golden Rum or Tequila, top shelf, optional
* 50g fresh ginger root
* Other spices to taste (I add a little nutmeg and clove)

Process
-------

1. In a small food processor, blend the ginger, sugar, and other spices
2. Drizzle in the juice and tequila while blending
3. Filter through a mesh filter.  You should have a nasty-looking brown syrup.
4. Chill syrup to near-freezing.
5. Mix syrup with equal volume seltzer and let settle
6. Add mixture slowly and carefully to the remainder of the seltzer.
