Mushroom Lasagna noodles
========================

* 175g varietal dry mushrooms, powdered (porcini, morel, shiitake)
* 65g vital wheat gluten
* 15g dry herbs (parsley, basil, oregano, etc)
* 1.5g salt
* 3 large to 4 small eggs

Instructions
------------

1. Combine the flour, mushroom powder, herbs, and salt in a bowl. 
2. Pour the mixture out onto a clean work surface into a mound. 
3. Create a large well in the center, and crack the eggs into the well.
4. Gradually incorporate the flour mixture from the sides of the well into the eggs. 
5. Work the ingredients together until it forms a rough and sticky ball. 
6. If the dough is too sticky, add a small amount of flour. 
7. If the dough is too dry, add a few drops of cold water.
8. Scrape the dough off the work surface, press into a rough ball, and knead for about 5 minutes. The dough should be very smooth and elastic. There will be about 400g of pasta dough.
9. Shape the dough in a ball and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Let rest for 20 minutes at room temperature.
10. Unwrap the ball of dough and cut into 4 pieces. Put 3 pieces back into the plastic wrap so that they don’t dry out. Flatten the remaining piece of dough into a rough rectangle.
11. Following the manufacturer’s instructions for your pasta machine, feed the flattened piece of dough into the machine at the widest setting. 
12. Fold the dough into thirds and then feed again into the machine. Repeat folding and rolling two additional times. 
13. Decrease the roller setting one notch. 
14. Sprinkle the pasta lightly with flour if necessary (may not be needed) and feed through the rollers again, unfolded. 
15. Turn the roller setting another notch and repeat the rolling, then continue without folding the dough until you get to the 5th setting. 
16. Cut to desired size.
17. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough.
