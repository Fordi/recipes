# From-scratch Ranch Dressing

### Equipment

* Mixing bowl
* rammekins
* Mortar and pestle
* Whisk

### Seasoning

* 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 1/4 tsp hot mustard
* 1 pinch white sugar
* 1/2 tsp dry parsley
* 1 tsp dry dill weed
* 1/2 tsp dry chives
* 1/4 tsp onion powder
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp black pepper

1. Crush to a fine powder in mortar and pestle

("fine" is important here; you need small particles to encourage a good emulsion).  If you stop here, and add 3 tbsp of dry milk powder, 1 tbsp butter solids, and 1/8 tsp each sodium acetate and sodium citrate, you've made a packet of dry ranch dressing.

#### Yolk

* 1 egg

1. Run under room-temperature water for about 2 minutes
2. Crack egg and separate yolk and whites into rammekins

### Acid

* Juice of one lime
* Enough cider vinegar to top out 2 tbsp

1. Combine in rammekin

### Oil

* 1/2 c extra virgin olive oil

1. Set aside in rammekin

### Emulsion

This is basically a recipe for mayonnaise.

* Yolk
* Seasoning
* Acid
* Oil

1. Combine yolk and seasoning, and whisk until homogenous and creamy
2. Continue whisking and add half of acid
3. Continue whisking and _slowly_ add half of oil
4. Continue whisking until mayo-textured
5. Continue whisking and add remaining acid
6. Continue whisking and _slowly_ add remainder of oil

### Ranch

* Emulsion
* 1/2 c plain yogurt
* 1/2 c buttermilk

1. Combine emulsion, yogurt, and buttermilk and whisk until homogenous

#### Substitutions

* Lemon juice <-> lime juice
* Milk <-> buttermilk
* Sour creme <-> yogurt
* garlic powder <-> minced fresh garlic simmered in the oil until golden
    * filter the oil, keep and crush the solids with the rest of the seasonings
    * allow oil to cool before emulsifying
* turbinado sugar <-> demerrara sugar <-> white sugar
* cider vinegar <-> wine vinegar <-> white vinegar
* extra virgin olive oil <-> whatever oil you prefer
    * Some consider EVOO to be too bitter for this application.  A favored choice here is also safflower oil, but I consider that too bland for the seasonings we pile on top.  YMMV.  Whatever you pick, it should be liquid at room temperature.  Coconut oil will make the texture _weird_.

Seasoning is flexible, but dill, onion and chives are necessary.  Don't mess too much with the salt level; you'll mess up the emulsion.
