Super Mushrooms
---------------
* 230g (2 sticks) butter, at room temperature
* 180g (1.5c sifted) AP flour
* 125g (1c, sifted) whole wheat flour
* 5g (3/4 tsp) salt
* 250g Greek yogurt
* 100g semisoft / firm cheese

Combine the flours in a small bowl.
Cream the butter, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and herbs.
Add the ricotta and mix well to combine.
Add the flour mixture and mix briefly to combine.
Add the cheese and mix until combined.
Roll the dough into a log and wrap it with parchment or plastic wrap. Rest the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350F.
Remove the roll from the freezer and roll in paprika. Brush off the excess paprika.
Slice 1/4" thick 'coins' of the dough and place them 1" apart on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Bake 20 - 25 minutes, flipping the cookies over midway through to allow them to brown evenly on both sides.
