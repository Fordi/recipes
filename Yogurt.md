# Homemade Yogurt

by [Howard Tayler](https://twitter.com/howardtayler/status/1498343058089254913)

I've been making yogurt in the sous vide, and it's gone perfectly so many times in a row that I am now comfortable sharing the recipe. 

Also, today I made [key lime pie yogurt](#key-lime-pie-yogurt-recipe)[¹] with it, and that came out perfectly[²] too.

## Yogurt Recipe

### Ingredients

* 1/2 cup yogurt starter. I used plain whole milk Greek yogurt at first, but now I just use a bit of yogurt from my previous batch
* 1/2 gallon whole milk

### Equipment

* Two 1qt mason jars[³] w/ lids
* An immersion circulator
* A yogurt strainer or fine cheesecloth

### Directions

1. Pour the milk in the jars, leaving just enough room at the top for the yogurt starter, which you will NOT add yet. 
2. Put the lids on, put them in the sous vide bath, and set it for 180°F for an hour.[⁴]
3. When they're done, cool them carefully.[⁵]
4. Add the yogurt starter once the milk in the jars has cooled to around 110° or lower (see note [⁵] for an easy way to determine that.) Use a VERY CLEAN[⁶] spoon or whisk to stir it into the mill really well.
5. Set the sous vide for 110°F for 24 hours. Put the lids back on the jars. 
6. A day later, you'll have about a half-quart of yogurt and a half-quart of whey in each jar. Strain the jars with a yogurt strainer or fine cheesecloth for a couple of hours.
7. How do you like your yogurt? If you want it clumpy and lumpy and "set," like those fruit-at-the-bottom yogurt cups, just pack it into a container in the fridge as is. If you want it creamy, take a hand mixer to it for a couple of minutes before fridging it.

And now, the sweetness... 

# Key Lime Pie Yogurt Recipe

## Ingredients

* 2 tbsp key lime juice. Or regular lime juice if that's all you have. 
* 1 can sweetened condensed milk.
* Some homemade yogurt.

1. Take the hand mixer I forgot to tell you that you'll probably need, and blend the key lime juice into the sweetened condensed milk. 
2. Taste it. Does it taste like key lime pie? Yes it does! 
3. Scrape most of it from the bowl into a leftover container.
4. Dump some homemade yogurt into the bowl, and blend with that hand mixer. I hope you didn't lick the beater in step 2, because we don't want mouth germs in our key lime pie yogurt. 
5. Taste it. Too yogurty? Add more key lime pie mix. Too sweet/limey? Add more yogurt. YMMV.

I realize this is a lot of steps, and a lot of time (for the yogurt, anyway) but it's stupidly simple. And once you have the yogurt, making it be key lime pie yogurt takes about two minutes. 

Obviously you can make other flavors of yogurt too. Again, YMMV.

FINAL NOTES:

-----

[¹]: #1

###### 1
Technically it's just lime, because I used lime juice and not key lime juice, but it hits the 80% mark if you're not a connoisseur of these things.

[²]: #2

###### 2
For "80% there" values of "perfectly."

[³]: #3

###### 3
Don't skip the scalding stage. You're not re-pasteurizing the milk, you're prepping the proteins for yogurty clumping.

[⁴]: #4

###### 4
Use mason jars, not leftover mayo jars. Mason jars can take the heating and cooling. Mayo jars cannot. I have proven this to myself. TWICE.

[⁵]: #5

###### 5
Shocking the glass jar by putting it in a cold water bath is a good way to crack the jar. I drain some of the hot water from the bath, add some cold water, and then run the sous vide at 110° until it beeps. It takes a couple of hours.

[⁶]: #6

###### 6
You're getting ready to create an environment in which micro-organisms can grow very happily. Don't introduce any germs you do not want to eat later.
